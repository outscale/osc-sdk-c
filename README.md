# Outscale SDK for C

Welcome to Outscale SDK for C.

**THIS IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS EVERYTHING CAN STILL CHANGE !!!!!**

**The Code is Generated using this: https://github.com/outscale-mgo/COGNAC**

## Dependency

json-c and libcurl (7.75 and after)

## How to use the SDK ?

Simply grab the C source and add it to your project, you need to include json-c and curl (version > 7.75) to your code.

See [examples](examples/) folder to jump straight into the code!
Here's an explication of the Makefile rule compiling example 1:

```
$(CC) examples/example1.c ./osc_sdk.c -I./ `pkg-config --cflags json-c` -lcurl -ljson-c -o example1 -Wall -Wno-unused-function -g
```
- `-I` to specify include path (so where to find `osc_sdk.h`, if osc_sdk.h where in the same derectory than `example0.c` it wouldn't be needed)
- `-lcurl -ljson-c` are to specify curl and json-c libraries.
- `-Wno-unused-function` because osc-sdk.c is compiled with the example, and not all functions are used
- `pkg-config --cflags json-c` to find json-c cflags
- `-Wall` for more warning
- `-g` for debug symbole

example0 is similar, but use an archive, so it can compile in ansi C (`-std=c89`)

## Notes:
You need libcurl to a version superior to 7.75 (again it's important)
json-c have deprecated ANSI C in favor to C99 and C11, if you want to continue using C89 you might stick to current or olded versions.
